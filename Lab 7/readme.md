## Laboratory Task
Our  application must enable the user to:

* Create a MongoDB database which would contain some secured sensitive data (protected
via 2-way encryption);
* Create an application which would display the data contained in the database (both
common data and the decrypted sensitive data);
* Make sure that the sensitive data can only be accessed via your application (i.e. it is
secure).

### Technologies
1. MongoDB Compass
2. Java
